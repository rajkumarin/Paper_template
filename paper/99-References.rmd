# References

<!-- 
In general, the references section can be blank.
Bookdown will just add in refrences you used, cite them as requested and procede on it's merry way.
Anything you want to force add without a text reference can be incuded here.
It is _probaly_ not helpful to add in supporting packages like `dplyr` unless it is a core part of your project.
