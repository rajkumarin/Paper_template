> **This is your most dangerous  folder.**
> **Please read carefully.**
> The reason this folder is dangerous is that while you may have access to a prior work, the general public may not.
> After you publish your work, delete all the PDFs from this folder and [purge the history](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).
> Just as you wouldn't like others pirating your work, don't help others do the same.
> If you are uncomfortable keeping PDF's online for this reason, I understand.

> The purpose of this folder is to hold all of journal articles your team is referencing _during_ the research process.
> This way when other members want to recall a prior work the effort is trivial.
> At the same time keep a running log of the bibliography.
> I recommend using [this](https://scholar.google.com/), [this](https://academic.microsoft.com/home), and [this](https://search.crossref.org/) to help automatically write your bibliographies.
> There is nothing more frustrating than hunting down that one source you remember reading that one time.
> If you are not sure you need it, toss in the PDF and add in the bibliography information.
> The knitting process will automatically prune anything you don't actually site.

> I like listing out bibliography in alpha sort order.
> I find it is easer to see if they are already in the list that way.

> After publication, please remember to delete and purge the PDFs!
