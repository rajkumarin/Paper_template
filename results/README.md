> All the results that you want to keep from script to script from the `~/code` folder should be stored here.
> Also keep publication tables and figures you generate that you want included in your paper in this folder too.

> In general I recomend when a script is called `~/code/foo.rmd` to make the resulting tables called `~/results/foo.RData`.
> Similarly figures can be called `~/results/foo.jpg`.
> Following this pattern allows for data linage to be maintained.
> When someone wants to know why a figure has a wrong scale, just lookup the name and then you will fine the script that generated it.
> This will save you a tone of time debugging.
